# Introduction to C++

This repository contains examples and exercises for learning C++ programming. It covers fundamental concepts and provides practical code snippets to help beginners get started with C++. The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. **Basics**: This section covers the basic concepts of C++ programming, such as data types, variables, and operators.
2. **Complex Topics**: This section covers more complex topics, such as pointers, arrays, and functions.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming**: This section covers the principles of object-oriented programming, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Each section contains a set of examples to help you practice and reinforce your understanding of the concepts. The examples are designed to be simple and easy to understand.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and open it in your favorite code editor. You can then explore the examples and exercises in each section to learn more about C++ programming.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yodkwtf/cpp-fundamentals.git
```

#### Usage

1. Navigate to the directory of interest.

   ```bash
   cd introduction-to-cpp/01-the-basics
   ```

2. Compile the C++ source file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

   ```bash
   g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable.
   ```bash
   ./hello_world
   ```

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed to build and run the code examples.
